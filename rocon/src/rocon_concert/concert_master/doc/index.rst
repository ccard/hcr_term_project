Concert Master
==============

Developing a multi-human-robot-device concert solution using the
`Robotics in Concert`_ framework begins here. This package provides a
configurable concert master roslaunch file that is responsible
for launching all the required infrastructure to run a complete concert solution
(minus the peripheral robots/devices/remocons which will connect to this concert
at their leisure).
