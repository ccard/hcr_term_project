Rocon Master Info
=================

The rocon_master_info_ package provides a script which advertises some basic information about this
ros master - icon, name, description. This gets used remocons and rqt plugins in 
the `Robotics in Concert`_ framework but is of general use to anyone wanting to
visually identify a ros master from a client gui application.
